# STAT 412/612  Homework 1 Key  (Coding may vary)

#1) Use and show R code to produce all even integers greater than 7 but less than 101.
    2*(4:50)

#2) Use and show R code to find the mean of all positive integers less than 100.
    mean(1:99)

#3) Write a function (using r code and structure demonstrated in class) to
#calculate a z score for a given observed value, a mean, and a standard deviation value.
#And then use your function to find a z score for the following problem. 
#(Research the internet to find the formula used to calculate a z score)
    
    Zscore <-  function(O,M,SD)
    {(O - M)/SD
      return((O - M)/SD)
    }
    

#Observed value = 25.77, mean = 23.54, standard deviation = 2.442
    Zscore(25.77, 23.54, 2.442)

#4) Use and show R code to round your z score answer in problem 3 to the nearest tenth.
    round(0.9131859 , digits = 1)

#5) Write a function (using r code and the structure demonstrated in class)
  # to calculate the natural log of a number multiplied by the common log of 
  # the same number divided by the cube root of a given prime number.
    
    Q <- function(x,y)
    {log(x)*log10(x)/(y^(1/3))
      return(log(x)*log10(x)/(y^(1/3)))
    }

#Use your function to find the answer if the number to be used 
#for both log expressions is 32 and the given prime number is 11.
    Q(32,11)

#6) Use and show R code to round your answer in problem 5 to the nearest hundredth.
    
    round(2.345548, digits= 2)

#7) Write a function (using r code and the structure demonstrated in class) that will
#create the first10 squares of positive odd integers. That is your function will give 
#you the following output. 1, 9, 25, 49, â€¦, 361 when you input values 1 to 10. 
    Seq <- function(n)
     {(2*n-1)^2
      return((2*n-1)^2)
    }
      
    Seq(1:10)
